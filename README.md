# My Portfolio

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.

The main goal of this project is to present my work as a software developer, focusing on real-world systems, product thinking, and practical problem solving.

The portfolio includes:
- A personal introduction and professional background
- A detailed case study of my main project (Viva Pay)
- Technical explanations about architecture and stack
- Contact and social information

## About the project

This portfolio was designed and developed from scratch, with a strong focus on:
- Clean and modern UI
- Clear storytelling and case study structure
- Real projects instead of generic demos
- Performance and good user experience

It is not just a visual portfolio, but a product-oriented presentation of how I think, design, and build software.

## Main case study

The main featured project is **Viva Pay**, a system originally developed as my final course project and later used in a real production environment, serving more than 5,000 users during a three-day event.

The case study covers:
- Real problem and context
- Proposed solution
- System architecture
- Technology stack
- Results and impact

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Running locally

npm install
npm run dev
